-- Name: Training: Missile Cruiser
-- Type: Mission
-- Description: Advanced Training Course
---
--- Objective: Destroy all enemy ships in the area.
---
--- Description:
--- During this training your will learn to navigate and use a jumpdrive, destroy enemies with broadside missile tubes and you will coordinate your attack with an allied beam cruiser.
---
--- Your ship is a Piranha missile cruiser - a jump-driven cruiser with broadside missiles, but without beam weapons.
---
--- This is a short mission for players who prefer tactical combat.
-- Variation[Hard]: Every enemy ship has drones.

-- secondary goal: Test and example for script_hangar (Hard variation)

In this training mission you will practice more advanced tactics using an Piranha missile cruiser.

Use your jump drive and your missiles to ambush a Kraylor maintainance dock. Do some damage to the station and ask for their surrender. We need resources and missiles from the maintainance dock, so do not destroy it.

Notice that your ship does not have any beam weapons.

Good work capturing that station. Some Kraylor ships are approaching. Ambush them before they notice something is wrong.

Use probes and science scans to find them and jump into a good firing position. It you run into trouble, escape and attack from a different angle or refill your missiles at the maintainance dock.

Plan each attack run carefully - a jump gone wrong will cost you much time and energy.

If you need beam weapons, feel free ask the April for support.
