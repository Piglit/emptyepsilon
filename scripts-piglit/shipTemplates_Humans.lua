-- Human ships

--[[

Description
-----------
This file defines some ships of a similar optical style with the background of several human factions.

Appearance
----------
The models from msgamedev.pack (AdlerLongRangeScout, ... , WespeScout) are used here, since there are various ship types with different colors each. So every human faction can have a different color scheme but still the same ships.

Colors
------
* White: owned and outfited by Human Navy. Players default color (adjustable in shipTemplates_Player)
* Yellow: Workers (stationary or unordered)
* Blue: Travellers (convoys and escorts)
* Red: criminals (enemy)
* Green: Ghosts (enemy)
* Grey: old default ships. (friendly)

Compatibility
-------------
All vanilla ship templates (except playerships) should also occure in this file with the same stats - the ship model may however vary. Using this file instead of shipTemplates_{StarFighters, Firgates, Corvette, Dreadnought} shall be sufficient to run existing scenarios. Special care must be taken with playerships, stations, transports and content from shipTemplatesOLD.

Ship Classes
------------
Some ship models use fixed beam or tube positions for their first beam/tube slots. The size of each ship is also determined by the models radius.

* Fighters:
	* Hornet(Interceptor, fighter, WespeScout, radius: 30, beams: 2, tubes: 0)
	* Lindwurm(Bomber, fighter, LindwurmFighter, radius: 30, beams: 0, tubes: 3)
	* Adder(Scout, fighter, AdlerLongRangeScout, radius: 30, beams: 3, tubes: 1)
* Frigates:
	* Storm(heavy attil, nonplayer, MissileCorvette, radius: 80, beams: 0 , tubes: 0)
	* Nirvana/Hathcock(Beam cruiser/sniper, frontal, LaserCorvette, radius: 80, beams: 0, tubes: 0)
	* Flavia/Repulse (Transport, rear fire, LightCorvette, radius: 80, beams: 0, tubes: 0)
	* Nautilus (player only, MineLayerCorvette, radius: 80, beams: 0, tubes: 0)
	* Piranha(Missile, no beam, HeavyCorvette, radius: 80, beams: 0, tubes: 0)
	* Phobos(light Cruiser, MultiGunCorvette, radius: 80, beams: 0, tubes: 0)
* Corvette:
	* Atlantis(Destroyer, AtlasHeavyFighter/AtlasDestroyer, radius: 80/160, beams: 2, tubes: 3/5)
* Dreadnought:
	* TODO

Strategic use in scenarios
--------------------------
Depending on the scenario and faction human ship may be found single or in small to large flottillas. Very often different ship classes/types are found within a single flottilla, since each ship is specialised in a specific task around a flottilla (e.g. fast Interceptor, Beam/Missile Cruiser, ...).
As script author you are adviced to spawn several random ships near each other that act as flottilla, if you do not need something special.


Human ships seldom use weapons of mass destruction like nukes or emps and almost never use very specialised technology like mines, warp jammers or similar.
Most human ships relay on beam weapons, homing and hvli missiles and strenght in numbers. You will seldom find a human NPC ship that is capable of fighting alone successfully.

Based on analysis of wars in human histoy some characteristics can be found.
Human like to use or create asymmetic advantages in war (e.g. numbers, surprise, a larger population of fighters, deception, ...)
Humans tend to avoid unneccessary losses. They will not sacrifice their troops without a change to achieve some goal.
However both can be spoiled by embarassed leaders or concepts of group honor.

Since there are differnt factions of humans with similar ship classes, there can be a wide range of strategies. Often flottilas of different ship types or classes can be seen. 

--LC light cruiser, allrounder
--MC missile cruiser broadside, no beam, defense against surprise attacks/surrounded - combine with BS
--BC beam cruiser anti fighter, defense against fighters/close combat - combine with MC
--TRN transport, maybe armed
--JCR jump carrier
--CRV corvette, destroyer - offensive allround 
--HMC heavy missile cruiser frontal assault, +beam, offensive
--stalker? nuker? enemies!
